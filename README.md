# wails-template-angular

Build beautiful cross-platform applications using Go + Angular!

# Getting Started

The following command will pull down the github template repo
and slightly customize it based on the arguments passed:

```bash
wails init -n wails-ng -t https://github.com/mateothegreat/wails-template-angular
```
At the time of this writing I used Wails v2.4.0 and Angular 15.2.0.

> I don't expect any breaking changes if you want to upgrade to an
> even newer version of Wails or Angular until at least after v3.0.0.


## Prerequisites

* Wails CLI v2.4.0 or newer (https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation)
* Node 16+ and `npm`.
* Angular CLI (install with `npm i -g @angular/cli@latest`).
